## NETWORK_SET_RICH_PRESENCE

```c
// 0x1DCCACDCFC569362 0x932A6CED
void NETWORK_SET_RICH_PRESENCE(int presenceEnum, Any* data, Any sizeOfData, Any numFields);
```

```
On PC it's a nullsub which means it does absolutely nothing.  
Now that Discord supports Rich Presence, R* might finally implement this for PC. Or maybe in future games like RDR2, GTA VI...  
```

## Parameters
* **presenceEnum**: 
* **data**: 
* **sizeOfData**: 
* **numFields**:
